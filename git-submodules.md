# Git Submodules basic explanation


### Why submodules?

In Git you can add a submodule to a repository. This is basically a
repository embedded in your **main** repository. This can be very
useful. A couple of usecases of submodules:

- **Separate big codebases into multiple repositories.**

    Useful if you have a big project that contains multiple subprojects.
    You can make every subproject a submodule. This way you'll have a
    cleaner Git log, because the commits are specific to a certain
    submodule.

- **Re-use the submodule in multiple parent repositories.**

    Useful if you have multiple repositories that share a common 
    component. With this approach you can easily update that shared
    component in all the repositories that added them as a submodule.
    This is a lot more convienient than copy-pasting the code into the
    repositories.


### Basics

When you add a submodule in Git, you don't add the **code** of the
submodule to the main repository, you only add **information about the
submodule** that is added to the main repository. This information
describes which **commit the submodule is pointing** at. This way, the
submodule's **code** won't automatically be updated if the submodule's
**repository** is updated. This is good, because your **main**
repository might not work with the latest commit of the submodule; it
prevents unexpected behaviour.


### Adding a submodule

You can add a submodule to a repository like this:

    git submodule add git@github.com:path_to/submodule.git path-to-submodule

With default configuration, this will check out the **code** of the
`submodule.git` repository to the `path-to-submodule` directory, and
will **add information to the main repository** about this submodule,
which contains the **commit the submodule points to**, which will be
the **current** commit of the default branch (usually the `master`
branch) at the time this command is executed.

After this operation, if you do a `git status` you'll see two files in
the `Changes to be committed` list: the `.gitmodules` file and the path
to the submodule. When you commit and push these files, you'll
commit/push the submodule to the origin.


### Getting the submodule's code

If a new submodule is created by one person, the other people in the
team need to initiate this submodule. First you have to get the
**information** about the submodule, this is retrieved by a normal
`git pull`. If there are new submodules you'll see it in the output of
`git pull`. Then you'll have to initiate them with:

    git submodule init

This will pull all the **code** from the submodule and place it in the
directory that it's configured to.

If you've cloned a repository that makes use of submodules, you should
also run this command to get the submodule's code. This is not
automatically done by `git clone`. However, if you add the
`--recurse-submodules` flag, it will.


### Pushing updates in the submodule

The submodule is just a separate repository. If you want to make changes
to it, you should make the changes in its repository and push them like
in a regular Git repository: Just execute the git commands in the
submodule's directory. However, you should also let the **main**
repository know that you've updated the submodule's repository, and make
it use the new commit of the repository of the submodule. Because if
you make new commits inside a submodule, the **main** repository will
still **point to the old commit**. 

If there are changes in the submodule's repository, and you do a `git
status` in the **main** repository, then the submodule will be in the
`Changes not staged for commit` list, and will have the text `(modified
content)` behind it. This means that the **code** of the submodule is
checked out on a different commit than the **main** repository is
**pointing to**. To make the **main** repository **point to** this new
commit, you should create another commit in the **main** repository.

The next sections describe different scenarios on doing this.


#### Make changes inside a submodule

- `cd` inside the submodule directory.
- Make the desired changes.
- `git commit` the new changes.
- `git push` the new commit.
- `cd` back to the main repository.
- In `git status` you'll see that the submodule directory is modified.
- In `git diff` you'll see the old and new commit pointers.
- When you `git commit` in the main repository, it will update the
  pointer.


#### Update the submodule pointer to a different commit

- `cd` inside the submodule directory.
- `git checkout` the branch/commit you want to point to.
- `cd` back to the main repository.
- In `git status` you'll see that the submodule directory is modified.
- In `git diff` you'll see the old and new commit pointers.
- When you `git commit` in the main repository, it will update the
  pointer.


#### If someone else updated the submodule pointer

If someone updated a submodule, the other team-members should update
the code of their submodules. This is not automatically done by
`git pull`, because with `git pull` it only retrieves the
**information** that the submodule is **pointing** to another
**commit**, but doesn't update the submodule's **code**. To update the
**code** of your submodules, you should run:

    git submodule update
    
If a submodule is not initiated yet, add the `--init` flag. If any
submodule has submodules itself, you can add the `--recursive` flag to
recursively init and update submodules.

##### What happens if you don't run this command?

If you don't run this command, the **code** of your submodule is checked
out to an **old** commit. When you do `git status` in the **main**
repository, you will see the submodule in the `Changes not staged for
commit` list with the text `(modified content)` behind it. If you would
do a `git status` **inside** the submodule, it would say `HEAD detached
at <commit-hash>`. This is not because you changed the submodule's code,
but because its **code** is checked out to a different **commit** than
the commit used in the **main** repository. So in the **main** repo, Git
sees this as a change, but actually you just didn't update the submodule.
So if you're working with submodules, don't forget to keep your
submodules up-to-date.


### Making it easier for everyone

It is sometimes annoying if you forget to initiate and update your
submodules. Fortunately, there are some tricks to make it easier:

    git clone --recurse-submodules
    
This will clone a repository and also init / update any possible
submodules the repository has.

    git pull --recurse-submodules
    
This will pull the main repository and also it's submodules.

And you can make it easier with aliases:

    git config --global alias.clone-all 'clone --recurse-submodules'
    git config --global alias.pull-all 'pull --recurse-submodules'
